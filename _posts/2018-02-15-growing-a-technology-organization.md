Starting a new company or project from scratch is __tough__! You get __punched hard__ on your body and on your mind, all the time! In this I gave at Codemotion Milan 2017, I'm sharing the mistakes and the things I've learned from the past 20 years of successes and failures in highly innovative and challenging projects. __The bottom line? It's all about people!__

The talk is about ~30 minutes long, enjoy!
