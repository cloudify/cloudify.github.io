It's been a while since the last time I've kept a blog - almost 10 years have
passed since I was active on my most ancient domain pixzone.com (registered in
January 1999).

Since then I've taken a lot of notes about many different topics, and now I've
decided to share some of them along with my thoughts.

Not to my future self: this blog is an attempt to come back to writing a little
more, I hope I will have enough persistence to keep writing for a long time!
